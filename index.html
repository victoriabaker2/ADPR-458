      <h1 class="headings">Editorial</h1>
      <p>Here, you'll find an article that I wrote as a part of the in-depth reporting project "Being Black in Lincoln." This project featured profiles of prominent members of Lincoln's Black community, and explored what their experience has been like as a part of Lincoln's racial minority. I had the privelege to profile Dominique Kelley-Johnson, a former Husker star athlete and current English teacher and basektball coach at Lincoln High. Read the article below! </p>

      <h1 class="headings">Script</h1>
      <p>Here, you'll find a script that I created in broadcasting course, "Media Writing and Content Development." This script acts as a snippet of a conceptualized and proposed pilot episode for a web series. Inspired by my favorite funny, teen-like series like Sex Education and Never Have I Ever, this script explores the discovery and "coming-of-age" phase of an LGBT youth who finds that she is miles behind others. The script is available for download here!</p>
